# Timepad

Everything was going mostly well after I started dual booting Windows and Arch linux, except that I wasn't able to find a good timer app which had a sort of picture-in-picture mode, just like the Windows timer app.

So I made this (no that is literally the reason why I made this app).

## Installation

You can use AUR packages `timepad` or `timepad-git` to install this app with your favorite AUR helper.
